# apple-platform-rs

This repository contains a collection of Rust crates to support Apple
platforms.

See the various project directories for more.

The most notable project is `apple-codesign`, which contains a pure Rust
(re)implementation of Apple code signing and notarization. This enables
you to sign, notarize, and release Apple software without macOS and without
Apple hardware.
